BCI is looking for an efficient, engaging, easy -to-use platform to administer, sustain and \nmonitor a corporate Recognition Program.  \n1.4.1 Background  \nIn late 2023 , BCI completed an Employee Engagement Survey, and as part of the Corporate Engagement \nAction Plan stemming from the results of the survey, BCI is moving forward with the development of a \nmulti -faceted employee recognition program.  \nEmployee focus  groups were conducted in June 2024 and participants spoke of the need for meaningful \nrecognition that is frequent, specific and authentic. Employees highlighted the  positive  impact of \nrecognition on their motivation when contributions are acknowledged and appreciated by their peers, \nmanagers, colleagues from other departments and senior leaders. While employees were supportive of \na corporate program to create consistency, the re was also a desire for flexibility to allow for \nconsideration of i ndividual recognition preferences.   \nRecognition of behaviours that demonstrate living our shared values was most frequently suggested as \nan anchor for the program; however, employees also see the opportunity to reinforce business \npriorities, drive innovation, incorporate core competencies, r ecognize community involvement and \nacknowledge achievements \u2013 providing recognition for a wide range of employee contributions. \nAcknowledgement of service milestones was something employees felt strongly about as they see it as \nan opportunity to demonstrat e that BCI values retention, loyalty and commitment.  \nWhile there is desire for tangible rewards associated with recognition, employees did not focus on the \nhigh dollar value s \u2013 instead it was important that rewards reflect the significance of achievements. A \npoints -based system was commonly cited as an approach employees experienced at previous employers \nwith the ability to redeem points for tangible rewards such as gift cards , branded merchandise, \nadditional vacation days or make charitable donations.  \nDuring the focus groups, employees  also shared suggestions on how to develop a fair and inclusive \nprogram that is accessible to all employees. They stressed the importance of clear criteria to support \nconsistency, supported by ongoing communication to encourage and sustain participation. T hey want \ntheir managers to be aware of recognition received, which will help equip managers with greater \ninsights into team members\u2019 contributions. Employees believe the program has the potential to create \ngreater cohesion  between departments and our global offices by making everyone feel like their \ncontributions matter as part of \u201cone BCI.\u201d", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7476762e-8d87-40ac-bf2f-69da22d68d58": {"__data__": {"id_": "7476762e-8d87-40ac-bf2f-69da22d68d58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "8 of 43 \n1.4.2 Current State  \nAt present, BCI employs the following methods for employee recognition:  \nShout Out  \nA feature on our  intranet (called the Bull & Bear  / B&B ), enabl es peer -to-peer recognition and social \ninteraction. However, in Sept 2024, a new intranet platform will be implemented \u2013 at that time, Shout \nOuts will be phased out  and no longer available as part of our intranet platform.  \nOperations Connection Awards  \nThis internal awards program  encourages employees to nominate candidates in predefined categories \non a quarterly basis. The successful nominees  are then highlighted in a newsletter distributed across all \nOperations departments  (this is not a corporate -wide program that all employees participate in ). It is still \nto be determined  if the Operations program will continue in the longer term or be incorporated into the \nnew corporate wide recognition program . \n1.4.3 Future State  \nBCI desires to actively  foster a culture of recognition aligned with our values and achieve the following  \nelements as part of our new program . The objectives of the Recognition  Program  are to :  \n\u2022 Increase employee engagement , strengthen our culture  and support living our shared values . \n\u2022 Reinforce what\u2019s important to our culture and purpose \u2013 anchor  the program  to our Corporate \nValues with opportunities to link to innovation, knowledge sharing, community engagement, \ninclusion, collaboration and other employee contributions & achievements . \n\u2022 Provide tangible rewards that encourage program participation and reflect the significance of \nwhat\u2019s being recognized, while also promoting frequent and timely intangible recognition as \npart of our culture . \n\u2022 Incorporate points1 that can be used to demonstrate appreciation & recognition, with \nemployees, managers and executives receiving an annual allocation of points to distribute.  \nPoints can be  redeemed for various types of rewards that allow employees to select redemption \noptions meaningful to them . \n\u2022 Acknowledge and celebrate  milestones that  reflect  employee\u2019s service to our clients, loyalty to \nthe organization and the importance of retention, although without  monetary  points/rewards \ntied to milestones . \n\u2022 Ensure program sustainment through ongoing communication, reminders, reporting & analytics,  \nand campaigns to keep it relevant and top of mind for employees . \n \n1 Where we refer to a point -based program, we are using that term to refer to the ability to \u201cmonetize\u201d recognition, which could be interpreted \nto mean dollars or \u201cpoint s\u201d with a monetary value.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec664673-c62f-44ea-957e-eb1e077e6d42": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec664673-c62f-44ea-957e-eb1e077e6d42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "9 of 43 \n\u2022 Provide clear guidelines which e nsure clarity, transparency, and consistency .  \n\u2022 Use reporting and metrics such as participation rate to assess effectiveness and identify \nopportunities for improvement as the program evolves and matures .  \nThe corporate Recognition Program is not intended to fully replace other forms of recognition. As part \nof the implementation process, work with existing awards program to help them determine whether the \nnew program is an opportunity to augment their existi ng approaches or if their program gets \nincorporated into the corporate program.  \n1.4.4 Key Capabilities  \nAt a high -level, the key capabilities of the platform and partner ship we are seeking are outlined below:  \n1) Social  Feed  \u2013 Employees are able to provide personalized recognition to each other that will \nappear on a  \u2018news feed\u2019 that c aptures a n employee recognition as it  is provided.  There must \nalso be the ability for employees to manage their own individual preferences as to whether or \nnot recognition received is public or private.  \n2) Point Distr ibution  & Redemption  \u2013 When employees provide recognition, they must have the \nability to provide \u201cpoints\u201d as an optio n.  The system will have the capability to assign point \nallocations , manage  points distribution and track redemption and individual \u201cpoint\u2019s banks.\u201d  \n3) Rewards  Catalogue  \u2013 The successful proponent will an existing online rewards catalogue that \nincludes a variety of rewards, including gift cards, merchandise and charitable donations.  BCI \nmust be able to add our own internal custom rewards to the catalogue (i.e., vacation time).   \n4) Milestone Recognition \u2013 Using employee data, ensure that managers and other team members \nare aware of service -based milestones and can acknowledge them within the recognition \nplatform\u2019s social feed . \n5) Support Awards Programs \u2013 The system will also need to enable employee awards programs \nwhere participation is limited  to specific segments of our workforce . This includes the ability to \nsolicit awards nominations.  \n6) Ongoing Campaign Support  \u2013 In addition to providing a platform to enable the key capabilities \nnoted above, the successful vendor will also be able to provide ongoing support, insights and \nresources that support the long -term su stainment of our new recognition program.  \n1.4.5 Expected Outcomes and Results  \nThe recognition platform should achieve the following key objectives : \n\u2022 Make it easy for employees to provide peer -to-peer recognition through an intuitive and \naccessible platform . \n\u2022 Allow employees to redeem points from an online catalogue from a variety of reward options \nthat are meaningful to them . \n\u2022 Enable acknowledgement  of service -based milestones in a meaningful way  \n\u2022 Automate recognition program processes  and reduce as keep manual administrative tasks to a \nminimum .", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe548f60-fd08-4d0b-ba68-1338287d8519": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe548f60-fd08-4d0b-ba68-1338287d8519", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {}, "text": "10 of 43 \n\u2022 enable management of e xisting employer awards programs .  \n\u2022 Offer Robust reporting and analytics  that will provide insights into participation  that empower \nHR and managers with actionable data . \n\u2022 Enable long -term sustainment of the recognition program . \n\u2022 have a positive impact on engagement, inclusion and our organizational culture . \n1.4.6 Service Location  \nBCI employs more than 700 people across our global operations, with 95% of our workforce based in \nCanada.

INTRODUCTION  \n \nIn line with the 2022 Colwood Creek Park Management Plan ( CCPMP ), the City of Colwood is \nplanning to install a prefabricated, multi- user washroom  / change room building at Colwood Creek \nPark. The building  location is shown on APPENDIX B: SITE PLAN .  \n \nThe City will provide water, electrical, and drainage connections, but the building  site is not \nserviced by a sanitary sewer. It is assumed that a pit type sanitary storage system will be required, however, it is desirable to maintain the same user experience as a fully serviced washroom facility, \nincluding flush toilets.   \n \nThe goal is to create an attractive, comfortable, and long -lasting facility at this location, while \nachieving cost savings compared to traditional construction. The building will utilize durable materials to withstand heavy use and resist vandalism. The se lection of finishes, materials, and \nspecifications for all components should consider the following:  \n- Aesthetics and sustainability.  \n- Functional and able to withstand intense use and periodic vandalism.  \n- Ease of maintenance and parts availability.  \n- Creative solutions for the lack of a sanitary sewer service.  \n \nBudget  \nThe City has established a budget of $307,675 to fund this project, including site preparation, \nservicing , and contingency.   \n6. RFP SCHEDULE  \n \nThe schedule for this RFP shall be as follows:  \nRFP ISSUED  SEPTEMBER 16, 2024  \nDEADLINE FOR QUESTIONS  OCTOBER 9, 2024  \nRFP CLOSING  OCTOBER 18, 2024  \nIt is anticipated that Proposals will be evaluated, and the project awarded by  November 12, 2024, \nwith work commencing  within 10 days of award and contract execution.  \n7.
