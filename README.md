The RFX_Insights notebook provides insights about RFX and ITX documents.

In this notebook, the documents in **Documents** folder are first processed and QA pairs are synthesized. An index containing the document embeddings is then created. 

To generate responses to queries related to these documents, simply load the embedding model from Hugging Face, load the index, and run the **Generating Response to Queries** block. Enjoy!
