BCI is looking for an efficient, engaging, easy -to-use platform to administer, sustain and \nmonitor a corporate Recognition Program.  \n1.4.1 Background  \nIn late 2023 , BCI completed an Employee Engagement Survey, and as part of the Corporate Engagement \nAction Plan stemming from the results of the survey, BCI is moving forward with the development of a \nmulti -faceted employee recognition program.  \nEmployee focus  groups were conducted in June 2024 and participants spoke of the need for meaningful \nrecognition that is frequent, specific and authentic. Employees highlighted the  positive  impact of \nrecognition on their motivation when contributions are acknowledged and appreciated by their peers, \nmanagers, colleagues from other departments and senior leaders. While employees were supportive of \na corporate program to create consistency, the re was also a desire for flexibility to allow for \nconsideration of i ndividual recognition preferences.   \nRecognition of behaviours that demonstrate living our shared values was most frequently suggested as \nan anchor for the program; however, employees also see the opportunity to reinforce business \npriorities, drive innovation, incorporate core competencies, r ecognize community involvement and \nacknowledge achievements \u2013 providing recognition for a wide range of employee contributions. \nAcknowledgement of service milestones was something employees felt strongly about as they see it as \nan opportunity to demonstrat e that BCI values retention, loyalty and commitment.  \nWhile there is desire for tangible rewards associated with recognition, employees did not focus on the \nhigh dollar value s \u2013 instead it was important that rewards reflect the significance of achievements. A \npoints -based system was commonly cited as an approach employees experienced at previous employers \nwith the ability to redeem points for tangible rewards such as gift cards , branded merchandise, \nadditional vacation days or make charitable donations.  \nDuring the focus groups, employees  also shared suggestions on how to develop a fair and inclusive \nprogram that is accessible to all employees. They stressed the importance of clear criteria to support \nconsistency, supported by ongoing communication to encourage and sustain participation. T hey want \ntheir managers to be aware of recognition received, which will help equip managers with greater \ninsights into team members\u2019 contributions. Employees believe the program has the potential to create \ngreater cohesion  between departments and our global offices by making everyone feel like their \ncontributions matter as part of \u201cone BCI.\u201d",

However, in Sept 2024, a new intranet platform will be implemented \u2013 at that time, Shout \nOuts will be phased out  and no longer available as part of our intranet platform.  \nOperations Connection Awards  \nThis internal awards program  encourages employees to nominate candidates in predefined categories \non a quarterly basis. The successful nominees  are then highlighted in a newsletter distributed across all \nOperations departments  (this is not a corporate -wide program that all employees participate in ). It is still \nto be determined  if the Operations program will continue in the longer term or be incorporated into the \nnew corporate wide recognition program . \n1.4.3 Future State  \nBCI desires to actively  foster a culture of recognition aligned with our values and achieve the following  \nelements as part of our new program . The objectives of the Recognition  Program  are to :  \n\u2022 Increase employee engagement , strengthen our culture  and support living our shared values . \n\u2022 Reinforce what\u2019s important to our culture and purpose \u2013 anchor  the program  to our Corporate \nValues with opportunities to link to innovation, knowledge sharing, community engagement, \ninclusion, collaboration and other employee contributions & achievements . \n\u2022 Provide tangible rewards that encourage program participation and reflect the significance of \nwhat\u2019s being recognized, while also promoting frequent and timely intangible recognition as \npart of our culture . \n\u2022 Incorporate points1 that can be used to demonstrate appreciation & recognition, with \nemployees, managers and executives receiving an annual allocation of points to distribute.  \nPoints can be  redeemed for various types of rewards that allow employees to select redemption \noptions meaningful to them . \n\u2022 Acknowledge and celebrate  milestones that  reflect  employee\u2019s service to our clients, loyalty to \nthe organization and the importance of retention, although without  monetary  points/rewards \ntied to milestones . \n\u2022 Ensure program sustainment through ongoing communication, reminders, reporting & analytics,  \nand campaigns to keep it relevant and top of mind for employees . \n \n1 Where we refer to a point -based program, we are using that term to refer to the ability to \u201cmonetize\u201d recognition, which could be interpreted \nto mean dollars or \u201cpoint s\u201d with a monetary value.",
